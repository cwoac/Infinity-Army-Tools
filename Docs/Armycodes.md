# Army Codes
These are the shorthand codes generated by Army builder representing an army. They are base64 encoded strings.

## Numbers
Integers are stored using a form of variable length encoding. If the value is under 128, then it is stored in a byte normally.
For larger numbers, two bytes are used and the first bit of the first byte is set high to flag this. 
Should a larger number still be required, then presumably it would go up to 6 bytes, but no number in the game gets remotely that high.

## Strings
Strings are encoded in the form `length, text`. and are not null terminated. 0 is a valid value for string length (in which case the text part will be absent).

## Code Structure.
The code can be broken down into two parts - the header and the combat groups.

### Header
The header is laid out as follows:
````
ID of sectoral (int)
Name of sectoral (string)
Name of the army (string) - defaults to ' '
Point _limit_ used (int)
Number of combat groups (int)
````

### Combat Groups
Each combat group is as follows:
````
combat group number (int)
number of members of the group (int)
combat group member (see below) x number of members
````

#### Combat Group Members
Each of these corresponds to a line in the army list in army builder.
```
00 (an empty byte)
Unit ID (int)
Group choice (int)
Option choice (int)
00 (an empty byte)
```
